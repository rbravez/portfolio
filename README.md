# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of completed data science projects. Presented in the form of Jupyer Notebooks, Python or C++ Scripts, when necessary. 

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out **[WIP - Javascript]**

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only*

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
2. Run noteooks as usual by using your prefered IDE.

## Contents
- ### Data Analysis and Visualization
  - #### Python
    - **[A/B Testing for Marketing Promotions Strategy](https://github.com/rbravez/portfolio/blob/main/projects/ABTesing.ipynb)**:  Performed an A/B analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different marketing promotions. Utilized ANOVA and Tukey's test to assess statistical differences in the control group. The analysis revealed that one promotion significantly underperformed compared to the others.
  - #### Tableau
    - **[Business Case: Analyzing Loan Performance for Strategic Decision-Making](https://github.com/rbravez/portfolio/blob/main/projects/Tableau/businesscase.md)**: Built a Tableau Dashboard (Spanish) to showcase the performance of loan-like product across different countries, extracted insights from a data visualization and was capable of extracting a meaningful conclusion out of it. 
  - #### SQL
    - **[Event Management Database Design & Operations](https://github.com/rbravez/portfolio/blob/main/projects/SQL/sql1.md)**: Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database to manage cultural events across multiple countries, incorporating diverse artists, event types, and cultural categories. Developed efficient database schemas to handle event logistics, participant data, and regional variations. Included optimized queries to demonstrate real-world database utilization and data retrieval.
  
 *Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Scipy Stats and Matplotlib.*
- ### Machine Learning
  - **[Time Series Analysis for Consumer Price Index on Rentals in Spain](https://github.com/rbravez/portfolio/blob/main/projects/Time%20Series%20Analysis/entregable.ipynb) (Spanish)**: Analyzed and built both Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models to forecast Spain's rental living CPI through 2024. Various techniques were used, including manual and automatic SARIMA, PCAF, and AFC. Exponential Smoothing proved superior for the dataset used.
  - **[K Cluster & PCA Analysis](https://github.com/rbravez/portfolio/blob/main/projects/K%20Cluster%20Analysis/Actividad%20de%20ACP%20y%20Cluster.ipynb) (Spanish)**: Cluster analysis for penguin population. Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means as unsupervised learning to succesfully differenciate between groups. Compared the algorithm sucess with the actual differences between species.
